# ML for Everyone

ML For everyone is a live show broadcast on the [IBM Developer Twitch channel](https://developer.ibm.com/livestream) every week at 2pm UK time.

The show is presented by [Matt Hamilton](https://twitter.com/hammertoe) and focusses on topics in and around machine learning for developers, with the odd smattering of random Python topics now and then.
